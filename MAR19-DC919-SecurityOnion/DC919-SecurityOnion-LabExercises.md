## Introduction
Placeholder

## Pre-requisites
```sh
You should have a Security Onion VM completely setup to proceed.   Ideally, you would have a snapshot of the fresh install that you can revert to between exercises.\

You should have some familiarity with Linux to be able to complete these exercises.   Some step-by-step instructions are provided to familiarize you with Security Onion or to ensure that exercises work as intended.
```

## Downloads
The following files should be downloaded to your Security Onion:\
https://github.com/wave-length/Presentations/raw/master/MAR19-DC919-SecurityOnion/Files/Ex1-honeynet.org-Scan19.tar.gz

### Exercise 1
1. Once you have logged into your VM, open a terminal window by clicking on "Applications", then "Utilities" and scroll down to and click "Terminal".   Change directory to where you have stored the downloaded Exercise pcaps.   If you used the Chromium web browser, those files are stored in the "Downloads" directory.
2. Extract the files contained in Ex1-honeynet.org-Scan19.tar.gz by using the following command:\
  mkdir ./Exercise1/ && tar fvxz Ex1-honeynet.org-Scan19.tar.gz --directory ./Exercise1
. Change directory into the "Exercise1" directory.
. Minimize the terminal window and double-click the "Squil" icon on the desktop.   Login to Squil using the credentials that you setup when you built the Security Onion VM.
